## Why tern

tern does what Termius and Tabby do for a list of servers (saved hosts, ⌘K to any of them, SFTP, splits, snippets and port forwards), but as one small native process. One connected tab takes 76 MB where Tabby takes 580 MB ([how I measured it](docs/perf.md)).

Passwords come from your SSH key, from a password-manager command such as `gopass show -o work/ssh/web-01`, or from tern's age-encrypted vault. At a `sudo` prompt, ⌘\\ types the password. It never types one on its own.

Hosts, snippets and settings sync to a private Git repository you own, encrypted on your Mac first. No account, no subscription.

| <img src="docs/screenshots/docker.jpg" alt="sudo docker ps with the sudo password filled by ⌘\"><br>**⌘\\ fills `sudo`**: the password comes from your password manager, typed only when you ask and only at a password prompt. | <img src="docs/screenshots/snippets.jpg" alt="The snippets picker filtering docker commands"><br>**Snippets (⇧⌘S)**: saved commands. ↵ marks the ones that run when picked; the rest are typed for you to finish. |
| <img src="docs/screenshots/split.jpg" alt="Two panes side by side with find in scrollback"><br>**Splits and find**: ⌘D and ⌘⇧D split a tab; ⌘F searches the scrollback. | <img src="docs/screenshots/sftp.jpg" alt="The SFTP side panel listing a remote home folder"><br>**Files (⇧⌘O)**: browse the remote side over SFTP; download, or drop files to upload. |

## Also in the box

- **Connections:** groups and tags, a one-time import from `~/.ssh/config`, ProxyJump chains, local, remote and SOCKS forwards, agent forwarding, and two-factor logins.
- **Staying connected:** automatic reconnect after a network drop, but never after you type `exit`. A changed host key stops the connection and shows the exact `ssh-keygen -R` line to fix one you trust.
- **Terminal:** tabs that reopen on launch, broadcast input to chosen tabs, ⌘-click links (including OSC 8), session logging, and a status line with latency.
- **Vault:** passwords and SSH keys in an age-encrypted file that unlocks with a PIN or the Keychain and locks when you're idle. A password command that arrives through sync must be approved once on each Mac.
- **Sync:** runs on its own, merges per host when both Macs changed, and only asks about a real conflict.

Every shortcut can be rebound in Settings. The full list, with the Windows and Linux keys, is in [docs/keyboard.md](docs/keyboard.md).

## Security

- Host keys are checked against `~/.ssh/known_hosts`. A changed key refuses the connection.
- Secrets live in the vault (age, scrypt) or in your password manager. They are never written to logs, and never typed into the terminal unless you press ⌘\\.
- Sync data is encrypted before it leaves your Mac. The repository sees `.age` files and a plain `tern-meta.json` (hash and time, nothing else).
- Losing a Mac doesn't lose your setup: see [docs/recovery.md](docs/recovery.md). Report vulnerabilities privately, as described in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Other platforms and building

Windows and Linux builds are on the [Releases](https://github.com/your-moon/tern/releases) page as a preview: they pass CI but haven't been run on a real desktop yet, so reports are welcome. To build tern yourself on any platform, see [docs/building.md](docs/building.md). To contribute, start with [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Feedback

tern is young (0.1.3), and I use it every day. If it's missing the one thing that keeps you on Termius, or something breaks, [open an issue](https://github.com/your-moon/tern/issues). I read all of them. Small fixes are very welcome too: the issues labelled [`good first issue`](https://github.com/your-moon/tern/labels/good%20first%20issue) are a good place to start.
